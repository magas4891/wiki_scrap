* Create a page that contains a form with only one text input field. Have it accept a Wikipedia link. Perform some basic validation making sure it's indeed a Wikipedia article URL.

* The title of the article
* The languages in which the article is available
* Put the relevant data of the article in a suitable data structure (just in code, no DB needed)
* Push the code to Github/Gitlab
